I was born and rasied in the beautiful state of North Carolina. I studied computer science at Duke University and have since worked as a software engineer. Currently I am spending my time traveling and building projects for fun.

The most important thing in my life is wellness. I have spent years experimenting with different nutrition, exercise, sleep, and mindfulness practices. With this effort I have found many Buddhist and Ayurvedic practices that work well for me, you can read more about them in my blog posts.

Please reach out if we share any interests. There are few things I enjoy more than genuine human connection.
