I was born and rasied in the beautiful state of North Carolina. I studied computer science at Duke University and have since worked as a software engineer. Currently I am spending my time traveling and building projects for fun.

The most important thing in my life is wellness. I have spent years experimenting with different nutrition, exercise, sleep, and mindfulness practices. With this effort I have found many Buddhist and Ayurvedic practices that work well for me, you can read more about them in my blog posts.
